    1 - Create a new Note, define its password, and writing the content of the message.<br><br>
    2 - Share the NoteID and password with as many people as you want.<br><br>
    You should send both pieces of information by different means. For example, send the NoteID by email and password by SMS/Whatsapp.<br><br>
    Every Note can be updated and reused many times by anyone who has the password.<br><br>
