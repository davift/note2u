    <b>ABOUT THIS SITE</b><br><br><br>
    This site has the objective of offering a free, anonymous, and secure way to communicate. It is a contribution of a regular user to the Tor network.<br><br>
    This is how it works:<br><br>
    The reference number of the Notes are randomly generated;<br><br>
    The password is not stored, only a hash of it;<br><br>
    The content of the note is encrypted using SSL techniques;<br><br>
    The Note can be accessed freely by anyone with the password but after 10 failed consecutive or 50 accumulated attempts the Note is automatically erased;<br><br>
    The maximum size of the content is 50kb, which is 100 times all the text of this page.<br><br>
    <br><b>WELCOME</b></p>
