The 'http' directory has to be the root of the webserver.

The 'data' directory should be outside of the webserver to protect the messages in the notes, passwords, etc.

Do not forget to change the e-mail in the 'contact.php' so you can get messages from the users of the site.

This file you are reading can be deleted.

Have fun!
