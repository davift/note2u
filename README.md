# note2u
Note2U is a web site made for Tor Network (DarkNet) and permits sending securely anonymous messages.

ABOUT THIS WEB APPLICATION

This site has the objective of offering a free, anonymous, and secure way to communicate. It is a contribution of a regular user to the Tor network.

This is how it works:

   - The reference number of the Notes are randomly generated;

   - The password is not stored, only a hash of it;
   
   - The content of the note is encrypted using SSL techniques;

   - The Note can be accessed freely by anyone with the password but after 10 failed consecutive or 50 accumulated attempts the Note is automatically erased.

   - The maximum size of the content is 50kb, which is 100 times all the text of this page.

SEND FREE, ANONYMOUS, AND SECURE NOTES TO ANYONE

   - Create a new Note, define its password, and writing the content of the message.

   - Share the NoteID and password with as many people as you want.

You should send both pieces of information by different means. For example, send the NoteID by email and password by SMS/Whatsapp.

Every Note can be updated and reused many times by anyone who has the password.

THIS CODE IS FREE TO ANYONE TO USE AND MODIFY.

It is running the Tor Network by the address:
